# Ava (Automated Virtual Assistant)

Ava is a little project of mine that I started back in 2018 to build my own virtual assistant. I utilise other tools like NLP.js and Face-api.js for Ava to hear and see things in the real world. I am looking at ways to integrate Ava into my home to control lights, heating and more all through NLP. The vision aspect of Ava currently just greets people when they walk through the door (if Ava has been trained to understand who that person is) and I am coming up with some more ideas on how this feature can be made more useful :)

## How to run

1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Jackthomsonn/ava.git
```

2. Navigate into the repo directory and run the following
```
cd <path-to-ava-repo>
docker-compose up
```
